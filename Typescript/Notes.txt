Brief on Typescript?
TS is a langugage based on JS developed by MS for creating client side code with strict type checking. JS does not have a strict type check while creating variables, so use ts to create the required code, convert it to JS and use it in ur apps. 
TS directly cannot be executed on any web environment. So U write the type safe code in TS,convert the code using Transpiler(Compiler for Typescript) to JS and use the generated JS code in UR web app development. 

If U want to compile multiple TS files together, then U could create a config file for TS called TSCONFIG.json and set the settings required for the list of the files to compile. U can also mention where the output files are to be placed.

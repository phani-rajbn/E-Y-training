        <h2>Basics of HTML</h2>
        <p>
            HTML is a markup language for developing web pages within UR Web Apps.
            HTML is not a programming language, there is no logic based execution. The content in the form of text is surrounded by tags called as markups which are interpreted by the browser to a certain format and will be displayed in it. 
            HTML Pages are viewable only thru' the browsers.

        <h2>Formating HTML</h2>
        <p>
            The following tags are used to present the text in a formated manner:<br>
            b is used for presenting bold text in the document<br />
            u is used to underline the text.<br />
            i is used to present the text in italics<br>

        <h2>Using tables</h2>
        <p>
            Tables are the way of presenting data in a tabular format. Here U can define a table with x no of rows and y no of columns. Rows are created using a tag called tr and each row will have one or more columns that are created using a tag called td. 
            To provide headings to the table, U can use th instead of td. <br>
            Tables can be borderless or with borders which will enhance the look and the feel fo the table. Please refer the tables video to understand how we create it.

            <ul>
            <li>Listings are the way to present the content in a listed manner: There can be Ordered lists or Unordered Lists. </li>
            <li>As the name suggests, ordered lists are placing the list items in a specific order defined by numbers(1, 2...), alphabets(A, B...) and so forth. </li>
            <li>Ordered lists are created using ol Tag and each element in the list is created with li Tag(list item).</li>
            <li>Unordered lists are created using ul Tag and each element in the list is created with li Tag(list item). Unordered lists are created as bulletted, circle, Square or any other style for listings</li>
